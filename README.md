<h2>Author:Shamika Diwan</h2>

<p>The `Book_Database_CRUD` project is a backend-based application designed to manage a database of books. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add new books, view a list of books, update book details, and delete books from the database. This project serves as a practical example of how to implement CRUD functionality using modern backend technologies.
